# hello-world
This is the first of many (fingers crossed) repositories. Let's gooo!

Name is David. I just decided to skip a wonderful pool time for learning GitHub. That doesn't mean I'm boring, that just mean that I have plenty of wonderful pool times a week so, losing one doesn't seem like much.
I hope I would have as much BBQ time as I have pool times, but life's not perfect ;)
